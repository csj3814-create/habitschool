# 개선 교훈 (Lessons Learned)

## 2026-04-16 (Admin Email Audit Visibility)

### 170. Cold-start Android shells must not rely on a transparent Custom Tab/TWA handoff as the only visible launch path
- Symptom: the installable APK could appear to do nothing when tapped, and on some devices it became awkward to uninstall until the user closed stuck processes.
- Root cause: the launcher stayed visually transparent while it waited for Chrome/TWA handoff, and cold-start browser surfaces could stall or ANR before any visible app UI appeared. That made the shell feel dead even when the process was technically working.
- Lesson: for installable Android shells, give the launcher an immediate visible surface and choose the most reliable browser handoff for the entry point. If share-target or other advanced flows still need TWA, scope TWA to those paths instead of making every cold start depend on a fragile custom-tab bootstrap.

### 171. The app-icon launcher flow should not share the same TWA path as advanced share or verified-link entry points
- Symptom: even after loading-screen and fallback fixes, the installed APK could still feel dead when opened from the home-screen icon or the package installer's `열기` button.
- Root cause: the normal `ACTION_MAIN` / `CATEGORY_LAUNCHER` path was still routed through the same Chrome TWA/custom-tab bootstrap used for trusted share flows, so any browser-side stall in that stack made the whole installed app look broken.
- Lesson: treat the app icon as the simplest and most reliable entry point. Open it through a plain external browser surface, and reserve TWA/custom-tabs for the flows that truly need them, such as share-target handling or trusted deep-link behavior.

### 172. A native-import success toast is not proof that the visible exercise UI kept the imported step count
- Symptom: Health Connect could say `Samsung Health에서 8,765보를 가져왔어요` while the exercise input and ring still showed the older saved value like `6,244`.
- Root cause: the deep-link handler applied the imported steps and showed the toast, but a later `loadStepData()` restore wrote stale Firestore `steps` back into the visible UI during the same session.
- Lesson: for native-to-web handoffs, verify the full render order, not just the event handler that shows success feedback. If saved state can reload after an import, the code needs an explicit precedence rule so the newest in-memory import survives the restore pass.

### 169. Android Browser Helper WebView fallback is not safe unless the fallback activity is declared and exercised
- Symptom: the hybrid app could launch fine when Chrome handled the TWA path, but still died on devices where no compatible TWA browser was available.
- Root cause: I enabled `WEBVIEW_FALLBACK_STRATEGY` in the launcher but did not declare `com.google.androidbrowserhelper.trusted.WebViewFallbackActivity` in `AndroidManifest.xml`. That meant the fallback path itself threw `ActivityNotFoundException` at runtime.
- Lesson: whenever I rely on Android Browser Helper's WebView fallback, I must add the fallback activity to the manifest and verify the path explicitly by disabling the browser/TWA provider during emulator or device QA.

### 168. If the user asks to keep the original app icon, scale or wire the existing asset instead of redesigning it
- Symptom: I responded to an icon sizing complaint by introducing a brand-new launcher illustration, which created a second mismatch: the app no longer looked like Habitschool to the user.
- Root cause: I optimized for visual cleanup instead of respecting the product constraint that the existing icon artwork itself was not up for redesign.
- Lesson: when the request is about icon size, padding, or crop, preserve the original asset and only adjust the adaptive-icon wiring or insets. Do not introduce new launcher art unless the user explicitly asks for a rebrand.

### 167. Never ship an Android install link without launching the built shell at least once on an emulator or device
- Symptom: I published an APK link that installed successfully, but tapping the app immediately failed because the launcher activity crashed before Chrome/TWA could open.
- Root cause: I verified the APK build artifact and signing/assetlinks assumptions, but I did not execute the actual Android launch path. A `LauncherActivity` subclass was calling browser-helper metadata too early and crashed only at runtime.
- Lesson: any time I share an installable Android build, I must complete one real launch on an emulator or device and verify the top activity stays alive. Build success and signature checks are not enough for install-link validation.

### 166. Native surface work must be verified on both footprint and round-trip behavior, not just successful builds
- Symptom: the Android widget shipped with a wider-than-expected footprint, and the in-app `Health Connect에서 가져오기` flow could return without importing steps in the user's actual shell flow.
- Root cause: I treated Android build success and code-path review as sufficient proof, but native UX depends on resource sizing and full deep-link round trips across web -> native -> web.
- Lesson: for Android shell features, verify two separate contracts before calling the work done: the rendered footprint on the launcher/widget grid, and the end-to-end return path from web CTA to native activity back into the web app with the expected payload intact.

### 163. Do not claim an admin UI is visible until the exact surface and entry point are verified in code or the running app
- Symptom: I reported that inactivity email audit details were available, but the user still could not find them from the member-management list.
- Root cause: I confirmed the data plumbing and modal implementation, then overgeneralized that into "the feature is visible" without checking the exact surface the user expected: direct visibility from the list itself rather than only inside a detail modal.
- Lesson: For admin tooling, verify the exact entry point the user named. If the request says "from the members tab," confirm whether the information is visible in the list, in a modal, or behind another click, and describe it precisely before saying the feature is available.

### 164. Sparse audit data should not render empty placeholder cards for every row in an admin list
- Symptom: once inactivity email history was surfaced directly in the member list, every user row showed bulky 3-day / 7-day empty cards even when no email had ever been sent.
- Root cause: I optimized for consistency of structure instead of density of useful information, so absent data got the same visual weight as real audit events.
- Lesson: In admin tables, sparse operational data should default to silence. Show compact summaries only when an event actually exists, and avoid repeating "not sent" placeholders across every row unless the user explicitly needs absence-state auditing.

### 165. Contract-based daily limits must be keyed to the contract's reset window, not the app's local calendar day
- Symptom: before 오전 9시 KST, the assets screen could show the full HBT conversion quota as available, but the onchain mint reverted with `ExceedsUserDailyCap`.
- Root cause: the UI and server pre-check summed successful conversions by KST `date` string, while the contract enforces daily caps by UTC day (`block.timestamp / 86400`), which resets at 오전 9시 KST.
- Lesson: whenever the product surfaces an onchain quota, derive usage from the same timestamp window the contract uses. For UTC-day limits, aggregate by timestamp range, not a local date label, and explicitly show the reset time in the UI.

### 94. Upload-speed improvements must not remove the short synchronous wait that makes saved video thumbnails feel immediate
- Symptom: after the upload-speed refactor, exercise video saves finished faster overall but reopened records and gallery cards often lost their thumbnail for a few seconds.
- Root cause: the new flow stopped waiting for `thumbPromise` during save and pushed thumbnail completion entirely into a later background patch. That improved save latency but regressed the "saved video already has a thumbnail" expectation that the previous flow provided.
- Lesson: when optimizing media-save latency, identify which post-upload artifacts are part of the user's immediate success criteria. For exercise videos, keep a bounded wait for the thumbnail during save, then fall back to background patching only if that short wait still misses.

### 93. Client-generated video thumbnails must be rebound to the final uploaded URL as soon as that URL resolves
- Symptom: even with a persistent local thumbnail cache, saved exercise videos could still reopen with a delayed live-frame fallback when the user saved before local thumbnail extraction finished.
- Root cause: the extracted thumbnail existed, but it was not immediately re-keyed to the final storage URL once the upload resolved. If save happened before `persistSavedExerciseBlock()` saw the local thumb, refresh paths still missed the cache.
- Lesson: when media uploads and client-side thumbnail extraction race each other, store the thumbnail under the final uploaded URL at both rendezvous points: when the thumbnail finishes and when the upload URL finishes. That way either completion order still leaves a refresh-safe cache entry.

### 92. A video thumbnail cache that only lives for the current session is too weak for refresh and gallery recovery
- Symptom: saved exercise videos could still show a placeholder for a few seconds after refresh, then suddenly show a live frame, even though the client had already extracted a usable thumbnail earlier.
- Root cause: the local extracted thumbnail cache only used `sessionStorage`, so refresh and gallery paths could miss it and fall back to slower live-video frame loading whenever `videoThumbUrl` had not been patched yet.
- Lesson: when a client-generated media preview must survive refreshes until the server-side thumb is ready, keep a bounded persistent cache keyed by the final media URL and make every consumer path consult that cache before using a live video fallback.

### 91. When a secondary processing UI keeps destabilizing the core media flow, remove it cleanly if the user prefers the pre-feature behavior
- Symptom: `썸네일 제작중` kept causing repeated regressions across exercise preview, refresh, and gallery/share surfaces even after several condition tweaks.
- Root cause: I continued tuning a non-essential intermediate state instead of recognizing that the safest path was to remove the feature once the user explicitly preferred the old behavior.
- Lesson: when an optional status UI introduces cascading regressions in a core flow and the user asks for rollback, stop layering more guards. Remove the feature end to end, preserve only the underlying persistence fixes that still matter, and return the product to a known-good baseline first.

### 85. When a processing badge lives on a generic upload container, the setter must verify committed media before rendering it
- Symptom: `썸네일 제작중` could still show inside a blank upload box even after the obvious pre-upload toggle was removed.
- Root cause: the pending-state host for static images was the whole `.upload-area`, and `setThumbPendingState()` trusted the incoming `visible` flag without checking whether the slot actually had a committed media URL and visible preview.
- Lesson: for any state mounted on a broad container instead of the media node itself, add a final render-time guard inside the setter. Refuse to show the processing state unless committed media is present and visibly rendered.

### 86. For image-based pending overlays, "visible preview" must mean computed visibility plus actual rendered dimensions
- Symptom: the thumbnail-pending badge could still appear on what looked like an empty slot because the image element technically existed and had saved metadata, but it had not rendered a visible box yet.
- Root cause: checking only saved-url state and a simple `display !== 'none'` test was too weak. An image can still be visually absent while those conditions pass.
- Lesson: when gating UI on whether an image preview is "showing", verify the rendered state with `getComputedStyle(...)`, `offsetWidth`, and `offsetHeight`, not only the presence of the DOM node or saved metadata.

### 87. Do not generalize intermediate media-processing UI across photos and videos when the product need is video-specific
- Symptom: `썸네일 제작중` kept leaking into diet and sleep photo slots even though users already see the original image immediately and only the video path actually benefits from an intermediate poster-generation state.
- Root cause: I treated thumbnail-pending as a generic media concern instead of checking whether the product actually needed that state for each media type.
- Lesson: if the UX problem exists only for video poster generation, scope the state to strength-video uploads only. For photos, show the original image directly and skip extra processing UI altogether.

### 88. When a UI policy is strict, enforce it inside the shared helper instead of relying only on call sites
- Symptom: photo slots could still show the shared thumbnail-pending badge even after several caller-side fixes removed the obvious `visible: true` paths.
- Root cause: the shared helper still allowed any host type, so a missed caller path or stale state could reintroduce the badge outside the intended video-only scope.
- Lesson: when the rule is absolute, put the guard in the shared helper itself. In this case, `setThumbPendingState()` must refuse every non-strength host and clear any leftover badge before returning.

### 89. Replacement uploads must not clear an in-flight pending entry just because the UI is still carrying the previous saved URL
- Symptom: replacing an existing media item and saving while the new upload was still in flight could end with `일부 업로드 실패`, even though the UI preview looked fine.
- Root cause: `persistSavedPreview()` / `persistSavedExerciseBlock()` used the presence of a fallback saved URL as a signal that it was safe to delete `_pendingUploads`. In replacement flows, that fallback URL could belong to the old media while the new upload still had not finished.
- Lesson: when a screen temporarily preserves the old committed URL during replacement upload, only clear the pending entry after the in-flight upload has a matching resolved URL. If the pending upload is unfinished or its resolved URL differs from the currently persisted one, keep the pending entry alive.

### 90. If a local video frame is already visible, treat it as a usable thumbnail and hide "thumbnail pending" UI
- Symptom: the exercise video card could show a clear frame preview while still overlaying `썸네일 제작중`, which felt contradictory and noisy.
- Root cause: the pending logic only looked for a remote `videoThumbUrl` and ignored locally extracted poster frames stored in `data-local-thumb` or already rendered in the preview image.
- Lesson: for video uploads, base the pending UI on user-visible state, not only final remote metadata. If a meaningful local poster frame is already visible, suppress the pending badge and let the remote thumb upload finish silently.

### 84. Secondary processing states should appear only after the user-facing item actually exists, and their styling should stay subordinate
- Symptom: the new `썸네일 제작중` indicator could appear too early, during the pre-upload phase before the saved media was visibly committed, and the badge styling pulled too much attention for what is only an intermediate processing step.
- Root cause: I tied the indicator to the file-transfer lifecycle instead of the committed media lifecycle, and I styled the text like a primary status chip rather than a soft, in-context overlay.
- Lesson: when adding an intermediate processing state, anchor it to the moment the user-facing artifact truly exists in the UI or database. For secondary states like thumbnail generation, prefer subtle blur/overlay treatment over loud badges so the main content remains the focal point.

### 83. Any dashboard summary next to a selected-date control must derive its state from the selected date, not a hidden `todayStr`
- Symptom: the `하나씩 기록` / dashboard hero at the top of `내 기록` kept showing today's score and completion state even after the user changed the date picker to another day.
- Root cause: `loadDataForSelectedDate()` updated the selected document and form state, but the dashboard hero still computed from `getDatesInfo().todayStr` and never re-rendered against the selected day's cached log.
- Lesson: whenever a screen has a selected-date control, audit every adjacent headline and summary card to ensure it reads from the same selected date source. If the form and summary can diverge, re-render the summary after the selected-date load completes and use the selected document cache instead of silently falling back to `today`.

## 2026-04-12 (Mainnet Cutover Regression)

### 82. Gallery caches must not replace a previously visible feed item with an incomplete background-upload draft
- Symptom: after saving a new exercise video or sleep image, switching to the gallery could show gray placeholders or even an empty-state message because the app replaced the visible cached item with a document version that still lacked finalized media and thumbnails.
- Root cause: the save flow eagerly upserted `galleryHydrationData` into `cachedGalleryLogs` and also triggered a forced `loadGalleryData(true)` even when media uploads were still finishing in background jobs. That let an incomplete Firestore document override the older, usable gallery state.
- Lesson: when media uploads continue after the main form save, update the record-tab cache immediately but defer gallery-cache replacement until background media reconciliation finishes. Never force-refresh gallery data from Firestore while the current save still depends on unfinished upload/thumbnail patches.

### 76. Dashboard hero summaries should concentrate the main metric near the headline instead of repeating it in lower stat cards
- Symptom: the `오늘의 루틴` card kept feeling busy even after the action rows were improved, because the daily score lived in a separate lower stat box while the top copy still lacked a clear headline-side progress summary.
- Root cause: I treated the hero as "headline plus extra cards" instead of deciding which single metric belongs in the first eye path. That left the top area visually weak and the lower area redundant.
- Lesson: when a dashboard hero has one dominant daily metric like `0/80`, place it directly in the headline summary cluster and remove any duplicate stat boxes beneath it. For mobile product UI, the first scan should answer `what should I do next?` and `how far along am I?` without making the user inspect a second row of cards.

### 77. Adjacent summary panels should be removed once the upstream panel absorbs their job
- Symptom: after the routine hero absorbed action status and daily point progress, the separate `오늘의 인증 현황` card immediately felt unnecessary and made the page look repetitive.
- Root cause: I improved the primary card but left the downstream summary card in place, so the page still repeated the same state in two different visual blocks.
- Lesson: when a top-level dashboard card gains enough clarity to cover a status summary, audit the very next panel and remove it if it no longer introduces new information. Better hierarchy often comes from deleting the second explanation, not decorating it.

### 78. Daily completion UI should use a realistic success threshold, not only the theoretical point maximum
- Symptom: the dashboard still felt discouraging because the routine hero implied users must hit the full 80 points to look "done", even though the real behavior standard is that 65+ points already counts as a successful day.
- Root cause: I tied the hero's visual completion state to the raw category maxima (`30 + 30 + 20`) instead of the product's practical success threshold.
- Lesson: when a habit system has both a theoretical max score and a lower "good enough" completion line, the dashboard should use the practical line for green-complete state, progress percentage, and headline summaries. Keep the per-category raw points visible, but let the success threshold drive the emotional feedback.

### 79. Collapsed dashboard heroes must keep the primary headline and daily score in the always-visible row
- Symptom: even after simplifying the routine hero, the card still felt noisy because the main title lived in the expandable body while the top row showed a small kicker plus a status pill. When the card was collapsed, the most important context disappeared.
- Root cause: I treated the collapsed row as metadata instead of the main summary surface, so the design duplicated information across a kicker, subtitle, points card, and lower copy.
- Lesson: for mobile dashboard heroes with a collapse affordance, the always-visible row should contain the real headline and the single most important metric or status. Supporting copy that does not survive collapse should be removable first.

### 80. Mobile dashboard headlines should fit a strict character budget before visual polish
- Symptom: even after the hero hierarchy improved, the starting headline `식단부터 기록해요` still felt a bit long and visually heavy for the compact top row.
- Root cause: I optimized the structure first but did not re-check whether the actual Korean copy still fit the tighter mobile headline slot.
- Lesson: once a mobile summary row is compressed to a single headline plus one badge, re-evaluate the headline copy with a very short character budget. If the user asks for a tighter phrase, shorten the source label and the fallback/default text together so the UI stays consistent.

### 81. On very small mobile widths, shrink badge chrome before letting a dashboard hero row wrap
- Symptom: the top dashboard row still broke into two lines on mobile because the title, completion badge, and `접기` button competed for space.
- Root cause: I had improved the content hierarchy but left the mobile badge/button padding and min-widths too generous, so the layout wrapped before the typography or chrome adapted.
- Lesson: when a mobile summary row must keep title + status + toggle on one line, first tighten the badge/button padding, font size, and min-widths under small breakpoints. Treat wrapping as the last resort, not the default.

### 75. Compact mobile action chips should be re-composed before adding more badges or metrics
- Symptom: after adding score badges to the dashboard `오늘의 루틴` actions, the three-column mobile chips became cramped and one label wrapped vertically, which made the whole panel feel broken instead of improved.
- Root cause: I preserved the old narrow 3-up chip layout and layered extra numbers onto it without first reconsidering how the content should scan on a phone-width card.
- Lesson: when adding new information to a compact mobile dashboard control, step back and redesign the composition first. Prefer fewer, clearer rows with stable hierarchy over squeezing more badges into an already-tight 3-column strip.

### 74. Integration success UI must not depend on an immediate fresh round-trip if the action itself already succeeded
- Symptom: after a successful Haebit Coach `!연결`, the modal closed and success feedback appeared, but the profile card still said there was no recent connect history until a later reload caught up.
- Root cause: the client wrote `chatbotConnectLastLinkedAt`, then immediately reloaded the user document and trusted that read as authoritative even when it lagged behind the just-completed write. The optimistic success state never got rendered first, so stale data could visually erase the success.
- Lesson: when a user action already succeeded and the client has the new state locally, render that optimistic success immediately and treat the next read as reconciliation. If the follow-up read is older or missing the new timestamp, merge the fresher local state instead of overwriting it.

### 69. Slow onchain wallet history must never block the first render or reuse a false empty state
- Symptom: the wallet `HBT 거래 기록` box could sit empty for ~20 seconds and then suddenly populate, which made users think the feature was broken even though the onchain data eventually arrived.
- Root cause: the client waited for the slow `getHbtTransferHistory` callable before rendering any transaction history, and the static HTML placeholder said "아직 거래 기록이 없습니다" before JavaScript had a chance to reconcile cached or Firestore-backed history.
- Lesson: when a wallet screen combines fast local/app history with slow onchain reconciliation, render in stages. Show cached history immediately, render fast Firestore history first, label the panel as syncing while onchain rows load, and only show a true empty state after every source has completed.

### 70. Pending integration state must not hijack the app's normal first tab
- Symptom: the app could open on `프로필` instead of `내 기록` because a leftover Haebit Coach connect token overrode the normal first-tab selection after sign-in.
- Root cause: the signed-in bootstrap treated any pending chatbot-connect token as a reason to force the `profile` tab, even though the actual connect confirmation can be handled with a modal from any tab.
- Lesson: when an integration has pending state, surface it with a modal, banner, or lightweight prompt first. Do not let unrelated pending flow state replace the product's primary landing tab unless the user explicitly deep-linked there.

### 71. Browser handoff flows need automatic recovery after the first transient failure, not just a passive pending banner
- Symptom: the Haebit Coach `!연결` flow could still feel broken because a Kakao in-app to browser handoff failed once, showed a pending warning, and then stopped progressing unless the user tapped `다시 확인`.
- Root cause: the pending token was preserved, but the recovery path only performed one automatic fetch and then entered a long cooldown on transient errors. That left the user in limbo during exactly the unstable few seconds after browser handoff.
- Lesson: for token handoff flows, keep the pending token and add a few automatic follow-up retries after transient failures. A pending banner is useful, but it should be backup UI, not the only recovery mechanism.

### 72. External integration domains must be added to CSP `connect-src` before relying on browser-side fetch
- Symptom: the Haebit Coach `!연결` flow kept sitting in a pending state even after retry improvements because the browser could not successfully fetch the chatbot API.
- Root cause: hosting CSP allowed Google, Firebase, BSC, and Kakao domains, but it did not include `https://habitchatbot.onrender.com`, so browser fetches to the chatbot server could be blocked at the policy layer.
- Lesson: every time a browser feature talks directly to a new external API, update `firebase.json` CSP `connect-src` in the same change and verify the actual domain is present before debugging retries, tokens, or auth state.

### 73. `!연결` UX must distinguish magic-link completions from fallback registration-code history
- Symptom: after a successful Haebit Coach `!연결`, the profile card could still say `최근 연결 이력은 아직 없어요`, and the modal could show a vague Kakao label like `사용자`.
- Root cause: the app only displayed `chatbotLinkCodeLastUsedAt`, which belongs to the fallback registration-code path, and it trusted the chatbot token display name even when Kakao did not provide a real nickname.
- Lesson: when a product supports both magic-link connect and fallback code connect, store and render separate history for each path. Also treat generic placeholder names like `사용자` as unnamed labels in the UI instead of presenting them as trusted account identity.

### 68. Wallet HBT history must be designed from actual token movement, not only from app-authored Firestore events
- Symptom: the wallet `HBT 거래 기록` box could show challenge stake and conversion rows but still miss direct HBT inflow/outflow that happened onchain, which made the history feel incomplete.
- Root cause: the first pass treated `blockchain_transactions` as the full source of truth even though that collection only logs selected product events and not every ERC-20 transfer affecting the user's wallet.
- Lesson: for wallet asset history, start by enumerating every real balance-changing path. If the product can receive or send HBT outside a narrow app flow, merge app-authored semantic events with onchain token transfer history and dedupe by tx hash instead of assuming Firestore alone is enough.

### 66. App fixes must go to staging first, then only go to prod after explicit user confirmation
- Symptom: some recent fixes were pushed straight to production even though the intended release flow was staging validation first.
- Root cause: I treated a small UI/runtime fix as safe enough for direct production deploy and did not consistently enforce the repo's deployment rule at the release step.
- Lesson: for every hosting/functions change, deploy to staging first, report the staging URL/status, wait for the user's go-ahead, and only then deploy to production. Do not skip the staging hop just because the patch looks small.

### 67. Stable invite codes must be issued server-side once, never regenerated opportunistically on the client
- Symptom: a user's invite link could appear to change because several client-side wallet/auth flows silently generated a fresh `referralCode` whenever the field looked missing or stale.
- Root cause: referral code issuance lived in multiple browser paths instead of a single authoritative server path, and Firestore rules still allowed the client to write `referralCode` directly.
- Lesson: any user-facing identifier that must stay stable should be owned by one server-side ensure/claim path. Clients may request or display it, but they should not mint or overwrite it. When tightening this kind of ownership, remove the field from client-write rules in the same change and verify cache/version bumps so old browser code stops trying legacy writes.

### 65. Transient wallet/challenge toasts need explicit UTF-8 verification before deploy
- Symptom: the challenge application flow briefly showed mojibake during the HBT approval wait state even though most permanent wallet UI text looked correct.
- Root cause: a copied toast string in `js/blockchain-manager.js` contained broken Korean text, and because it only appears during a short-lived approval state it was easy to miss in normal smoke checks.
- Lesson: when changing wallet or challenge flows, verify not only the steady-state screen but also transient toasts, loading messages, approval prompts, and retry warnings in the actual interaction sequence. If any user-facing copy changes, bump the cache/app version in the same fix so stale PWA assets do not preserve the broken text.

### 64. Any flow that stakes onchain before writing Firestore must persist a recovery handle and detect stake drift before allowing retries
- Symptom: a `5000 HBT` weekly challenge start could shrink the wallet by `10000 HBT` when the callable failed after the first successful onchain stake and the user retried the same challenge.
- Root cause: the client submitted `stakeForChallenge()` before the `startChallenge` callable created the Firestore record. When the callable threw a 500, there was no persisted `stakeTxHash` recovery path and no client-side check for unreconciled onchain stake, so a retry could send a second identical stake.
- Lesson: for every challenge-start or similar two-phase flow, 1) persist the successful onchain tx hash locally before the post-tx callable, 2) retry the callable idempotently using that tx hash, 3) compare onchain aggregate stake vs recorded active challenge stake before allowing a new deposit, and 4) do not treat a same-tx retry as a duplicate active challenge on the backend.

### 60. Mainnet cutover must include Functions env, service-worker cache bump, and stale chain-state cleanup together
- Symptom: production wallet copy looked partly updated, but halving progress still showed testnet totals (`49,200`), weekly/master challenge state from testnet kept rendering, and users could keep seeing stale chain-era data after hosting deploys.
- Root cause: hosting switched to mainnet copy, but production callable Functions were still falling back to testnet env defaults, the PWA service worker version lagged behind the app asset version, and legacy `activeChallenges` documents had no chain metadata so they survived the cutover untouched.
- Lesson: for every future chain cutover, treat the release as a 3-part migration: 1) bump app + service-worker cache version together, 2) pin project-specific Functions env files so prod/staging resolve to the intended chain at deploy time, 3) add chain metadata plus cleanup logic for existing Firestore challenge state before calling the rollout complete.

### 61. Wallet asset history and explorer links must resolve through the active chain, not generic contract pages
- Symptom: after the mainnet launch, the wallet tab could still show mixed-chain HBT history, plain contract-address links, and stale `currentRate` wording that made the source of truth harder to verify.
- Root cause: the HBT transaction feed was querying user history without an active-chain filter, the wallet links pointed to generic address pages instead of token-holder views, and cache-busted asset versions were not bumped alongside the wallet UI refresh.
- Lesson: whenever wallet copy or explorer links change, verify 1) HBT history is filtered to the active chain, 2) holder-facing links use the token page with the relevant address parameter, 3) visible wording matches product language (`비율`), and 4) app + service worker versions are bumped together so users actually receive the fix.

### 62. Point history UI must be designed from the real earning sources, not just the most obvious collection
- Symptom: the wallet showed only diet/exercise/mind entries even though users also earn or spend points through reactions, challenge results, admin adjustments, referrals, and bonuses.
- Root cause: the first pass built point history only from `daily_logs.awardedPoints` plus a small subset of blockchain transactions, while several other point flows either live in different collections or are not logged as history at all.
- Lesson: before shipping any wallet history UI, enumerate every `coins` mutation path first. Then separate them into: 1) directly renderable from existing collections, 2) derivable with acceptable queries, 3) impossible to reconstruct because no history is stored. If category 3 exists, call it out and plan a dedicated point-history write path instead of pretending the history is complete.

### 63. Keep helper Cloud Functions narrowly scoped; do not copy challenge-policy logic into unrelated wallet funding flows
- Symptom: wallet gas prefunding failed with a 500 and the client showed `현재 챌린지 보상 정책을 불러오지 못했습니다` even though the user was only trying to get BNB gas.
- Root cause: `prefundWallet` accidentally contained a copied challenge-bonus policy block and referenced `def.tier`, which does not exist in that function. A simple gas top-up path was therefore blocked by unrelated business logic.
- Lesson: for operational helpers like gas prefund, wallet export, or balance checks, keep dependencies minimal and audit for pasted logic before deploy. If a function does not need challenge state or tokenomics policy to do its job, it should not fetch them.

### 84. 날짜 기반 보상 제한은 클라이언트 문구와 서버 지급을 함께 잠글 것
- **증상**: 오래된 날짜에 대한 무포인트 정책을 UI helper만 바꾸면, 저장 데이터나 Cloud Function 지급 경로를 통해 여전히 포인트가 올라갈 수 있다.
- **교훈**: 날짜 cutoff 규칙은
  1. 저장 버튼 문구/CTA,
  2. 클라이언트 저장 시 `awardedPoints` 증가분 차단,
  3. 서버 `awardPoints` 지급 차단
  를 같은 기준으로 함께 반영해야 한다.
- **규칙**: “특정 날짜엔 보상 제외” 정책은 항상 client + backend 이중 적용으로 넣고, 이미 받은 과거 포인트는 유지하되 새 증가만 막는다.

### 85. 미디어 날짜 검증은 메타데이터 신뢰도에 따라 다르게 다뤄야 한다
- **증상**: 사진/영상 날짜 검증을 모두 같은 강도로 막으면, EXIF가 없는 캡처나 메신저/편집 앱을 거친 파일까지 정상 업로드가 막힐 수 있다.
- **교훈**: 날짜 메타데이터가 있는 사진(EXIF)은 신뢰도가 높으므로 불일치 시 엄격하게 차단하고, EXIF가 없는 사진이나 영상처럼 파일 시각만 남는 경우는 경고 후 예외 허용이 더 현실적이다.
- **규칙**: 사진 날짜 정책을 손볼 때는 `EXIF 있음 = 차단`, `EXIF 없음/영상 = 확인 후 허용` 순서로 설계하고, 수동 업로드와 여러 장 자동 가져오기 흐름을 같은 기준으로 맞춘다.

### 86. 세션 마감 전에는 코드뿐 아니라 작업 문서도 working tree 기준으로 정리할 것
- **증상**: staging이나 배포는 끝났는데 `tasks/` 아래 로컬 메모가 untracked로 남아 있으면, 사용자는 아직 안 올라간 파일이 있다고 느끼고 마감 상태가 흐려진다.
- **교훈**: 이 저장소에서는 task note도 작업 산출물의 일부다. 마감 전에 `git status`를 보고 남아 있는 문서가 의도된 미추적인지, 정리해야 할 기록인지 구분해야 한다.
- **규칙**: “오늘 작업 여기까지”나 “문서까지 깔끔하게 정리” 요청이 오면, 마지막 단계에서 반드시 `git status --short`로 문서 흔적까지 확인하고 필요한 task note를 commit 범위에 포함한다.

### 74. Keep destructive actions in one clear place per card flow
- When a summary row and a detail row describe the same pending item, place cancel in only one location.
- For social challenge cards, the summary row can show status, and the lower detail row can own the cancel action.

### 75. Mirror UI concurrency rules on the server
- If the modal disables a challenge type or filters out a busy friend, the callable must enforce the same rules.
- This prevents stale tabs or race conditions from creating invalid challenge combinations.

### 76. Save flows must read the current analysis state, not stale loaded data
- If AI analysis can be generated after the page loads, the save payload must be built from the current UI or refreshed cache.
- Reusing the originally loaded document can silently overwrite freshly saved analysis and break restore or gallery badges.

### 77. Mobile layout changes need screenshot-level checks, not just desktop logic
- If a new CTA uses a custom mobile media query, verify the stacked result on a narrow viewport before calling the layout done.
- Do not switch a compact two-row card to a single-column mobile layout unless the screenshot clearly proves that wrapping is better.

### 78. Event-gated install prompts need manual fallbacks on mobile
- If a first-screen install CTA depends only on beforeinstallprompt, iOS and many mobile browser contexts will never show it.
- Pair the native prompt path with manual install guidance, dismissal expiry, and a compact fallback state so the CTA remains discoverable.

### 79. Critical install CTAs should use persistent contextual surfaces
- If installation is a key action, place it in a stable CTA slot instead of a transient floating banner.
- Auto-dismissing or event-gated install banners are too easy to miss on mobile and too dependent on browser prompt timing.

### 80. Shared CTA helpers must not clobber special tab modes
- If a bottom CTA slot is reused across tabs, the shared update helper must explicitly skip tab-specific modes like install or community chat.
- Otherwise background guide refreshes can keep the old label while resetting the style and behavior underneath it.

### 81. Web push permission must be explicit and platform-aware
- Do not auto-call `Notification.requestPermission()` after login or page load.
- Keep web push opt-in behind a clear user action, and on iPhone require the installed home screen app path before asking for permission.

### 82. After editing browser entry modules, run the real browser bundle check
- A syntax error in `js/auth.js` can break login even if the rest of the app looks mostly unchanged.
- After touching auth or other top-level browser modules, run the esbuild bundle check immediately before reporting success.

### 83. Preserve UTF-8 when touching user-facing Korean strings
- If a JS file contains Korean UI copy, avoid shell rewrite patterns that can silently corrupt encoding into mojibake.
- After editing user-facing text, verify the actual rendered copy on staging or with a bundle check before calling it done.

### 84. Browser permission state and app push state are different UX problems
- A granted browser notification permission does not mean the app should always be actively subscribed to push.
- For simpler UX, keep browser permission as a prerequisite and offer a separate app-level one-tap push on/off toggle once permission is granted.

### 85. When browser settings block recovery, replace text walls with guided visuals
- If a web permission cannot be re-enabled in-app, do not leave users with a long paragraph or alert.
- Provide a browser-aware guide modal with a mocked visual path so users can map the instructions to what they see on screen.

### 86. Do not duplicate modal dismiss actions without distinct value
- If a modal already has one clear confirmation/dismiss CTA, avoid adding a second footer button that performs the same close action.
- Redundant close controls make simple guidance modals feel more complex than they are.

### 87. Install CTA visibility should track installed state, not just standalone mode
- If an install CTA is shown in a persistent bottom bar, hiding it only in standalone mode is not enough.
- On supported browsers, combine `appinstalled` memory with installed-app detection so browser tabs stop showing install guidance after installation, and let the CTA return only when the browser reports installation is available again.

### 88. Installed PWA copy must not keep saying "browser" when the user is in the app shell
- Android installed PWAs can still inherit blocked web notification permissions, but the UX should describe that state in app language first.
- If recovery still requires browser/site settings, explain that clearly in the helper or guide instead of showing a browser-only phrase on the main card.

### 89. Do not clear installed CTA state from install-available events alone
- `beforeinstallprompt` means the browser may offer installation, but it is not strong enough by itself to prove the app is no longer installed.
- Keep installed CTA suppression tied to actual installed-app detection or shared install state so browser tabs do not resurrect the install bar after installation.

## 2026-04-08 (share target import bug)

### 60. Non-picker image imports must not hard-fail on optional EXIF helpers
- Symptom: Android share-target opened the diet tab but showed `占싱뱄옙占쏙옙 占싻쇽옙 占쏙옙占쏙옙占?占쏙옙占쏙옙占싹댐옙.` and saved nothing.
- Root cause: shared files were routed through `smartUpload()`, which blocked the entire import when `EXIF` had not loaded yet.
- Lesson: share-target and other non-picker upload paths should accept raw `File` arrays directly and fall back to `lastModified` metadata when EXIF is unavailable. Optional analysis helpers must never block the basic save flow.

### 90. Native shell branding must reuse the real app icon from day one
- If the repo already has a production PWA/app icon, do not ship the Android shell with a placeholder launcher icon.
- Before sharing a test APK, verify launcher icon, app label, and other visible branding assets match the existing product brand to avoid duplicate-looking installs.

### 91. Adaptive launcher icons need inset-safe foregrounds
- Reusing the real product icon is not enough for Android launcher icons; adaptive icons crop the foreground inside a mask on many launchers.
- Before shipping a test APK, verify the launcher icon on a real Samsung/One UI device and keep text or logos away from the mask edges by using an inset foreground asset.


## 2026-04-08 (Android shell follow-up)

### 92. Android-only actions must live in always-visible task surfaces
- **Symptom**: The user could not find the Health Connect action because it was placed inside a collapsible guide row, and launcher entry did not always preserve the explicit Android-shell marker.
- **Lesson**: If an Android-specific action supports a primary workflow like step entry, place it inside the relevant working card near the input controls. Also stamp launcher entry with an explicit `native=android-shell` marker instead of depending on later deep-link flows.


## 2026-04-08 (mobile helper copy)

### 93. Bottom-bar helper copy should be written for one-line mobile fit first
- **Symptom**: The mind-tab save helper wrapped into two lines on Android because it tried to explain both readiness count and motivational guidance in the fixed bottom bar.
- **Lesson**: For the bottom save bar, prefer one compact sentence that communicates only the next action or readiness state. Treat longer motivational copy as optional and keep helper strings short enough for narrow mobile screens first.


## 2026-04-08 (Health Connect step alignment)

### 94. Generic Health Connect aggregates do not necessarily match a specific source app's visible total
- **Symptom**: The imported step count was much lower than the Samsung Health number shown on the same device.
- **Lesson**: For Activity data like steps, Health Connect aggregate reads can be deduped across apps and reflect sync timing rather than a single provider's UI total. If the product promise is "match Samsung Health," prefer Samsung Health's `DataOrigin` when available and label the imported source explicitly.


## 2026-04-08 (diet helper copy)

### 95. Fasting helper copy should describe the metric group, not the raw field count
- **Symptom**: The diet-tab save helper said things like `?? 4?`, which sounded unnatural and product-hostile even though it was technically counting filled fields.
- **Lesson**: For user-facing health copy, prefer the domain term such as `?? ??` over raw input counts unless the count itself is meaningful to the user.

## 2026-04-08 (Android share sheet)

### 96. A PWA share target does not make the Android shell appear in the native share sheet
- **Symptom**: The user could share images into the installed PWA earlier, but the debug APK itself did not appear in Samsung's app share list and looked like a regression.
- **Lesson**: Treat the PWA and the Android shell as separate share surfaces. If the Android APK must appear in the native share sheet, add the full TWA share-target contract on the Android side: share-target metadata, `SEND` and `SEND_MULTIPLE` intent filters, the Trusted Web Activity delegation service, and a matching asset links fingerprint set for the build being tested.

## 2026-04-08 (Android repeat regressions)

### 97. Source filtering alone is not enough to match Samsung Health step totals
- **Symptom**: After switching from generic Health Connect totals to Samsung Health-only aggregation, the Android shell still showed a lower step count than the Samsung Health app.
- **Lesson**: For Health Connect step sync, do not assume one aggregate query is the whole truth. Compare multiple views of the same day, including source-filtered aggregates and raw `StepsRecord` sums, and choose the best available value before labeling it as a Samsung Health import.

### 98. Do not re-tune a launcher icon that already passed on-device validation without rechecking the device result
- **Symptom**: The launcher icon looked correct in one verified APK, then regressed back to a face-only crop after a later inset tweak.
- **Lesson**: Once a launcher icon has been explicitly approved on the target device family, treat that asset/layout as locked. Any later icon adjustment must be justified by a new issue and followed by fresh device validation before shipping another APK.

## 2026-04-08 (onboarding and gallery engagement)

### 99. Signup onboarding must be gated by the actual signup event, not by a missing profile flag alone
- **Symptom**: An existing user saw the signup welcome modal again after installing the Android APK because `onboardingComplete` was missing in Firestore.
- **Lesson**: Treat onboarding as a one-time signup event, not a generic app-entry state. Show signup onboarding only when the current auth flow explicitly reports a fresh signup, and never re-trigger it just because a legacy profile field is absent.

### 100. Gallery engagement scores must count unique users per post, not raw interaction volume
- **Symptom**: Multiple comments on the same post and switching between reaction types could inflate gallery/community scores and reaction coin awards.
- **Lesson**: For anti-abuse scoring, count at most one qualifying comment and one qualifying reaction per user per post. Apply the same rule consistently in client rankings, backend community stats, and any point-award function.

---## 2026-04-09 (milestone hierarchy normalization)

### 102. Higher claimed milestones must implicitly close lower steps in the same category
- Symptom: Legacy users could see diet1, exercise1, or mind1 reappear as fresh +5P start rewards even though higher milestones in the same category were already completed or claimed.
- Lesson: Milestone rendering and reconciliation must treat each category as an ordered ladder. If a higher step is already achieved or claimed, all lower steps should be marked achieved too, and any lower step beneath a claimed milestone should be treated as already closed to avoid replaying starter rewards or events.

---
## 2026-04-09 (simple-mode copy length)

### 103. Simple-mode guidance copy must fit the actual card width, not just read well in isolation
- Symptom: The default mind guidance sentence in simple mode was understandable but long enough to clip on the larger accessibility-first card layout.
- Lesson: In simple or senior-facing surfaces, prefer short action copy that fits in one stable line block on common mobile widths. If two versions say the same thing, ship the shorter verb-first phrasing.
## 2026-04-09 (simple-mode chrome and guide density)

### 104. In simple mode, prefer one small escape hatch over a full explainer banner and keep guide cards action-only
- Symptom: The large simple-mode banner and guide-card status copy made the accessibility-first layout feel heavier than necessary even after shortening individual sentences.
- Lesson: For senior-facing or simple-mode screens, default to a small top-level escape hatch such as a single 湲곕낯 button in the header. Inside action cards, remove explanatory copy when the next action is already obvious from the button labels.
## 2026-04-09 (simple-mode action hierarchy)

### 105. In simple mode, button labels and color roles should carry the guidance instead of extra sentences
- Symptom: Even after removing guide copy, the action order and labels still felt less obvious until the primary actions were renamed and color-coded by intent.
- Lesson: For accessibility-first mobile flows, make the button stack self-explanatory. Put the most direct action first, use stable color roles such as green for immediate capture/input and orange for the secondary nudge, and normalize repeated wording like 媛먯궗 ?쇨린 everywhere users see it.
## 2026-04-09 (simple-mode header emphasis)

### 106. In simple mode, the brand header should stay more prominent than the escape button, and CTA copy should drop redundant category words
- Symptom: After simplifying the header, the top-right escape button label and the smaller brand text made the simple-mode entry feel less anchored, and the mind save CTA still read longer than necessary.
- Lesson: In accessibility-first headers, enlarge the brand icon/name and keep the mode-switch button secondary even when it remains visible. For save CTAs, remove redundant words like `record` when the current tab already provides that context.
## 2026-04-09 (simple-profile QR-first cleanup)

### 107. In simple profile surfaces, remove explanatory filler and prefer QR-first cards with the install action in the footer CTA
- Symptom: The first simple-profile version still had extra helper sentences, a link/copy row for invites, and the install action inside a content card, which made the screen feel busier than the user wanted.
- Lesson: For senior-facing simple profile screens, keep points prominent, collapse invite/community actions to large QR cards with a single short camera prompt, and move the install action to the bottom CTA instead of keeping it as another profile card.

## 2026-04-09 (simple-profile footer CTA state)

### 108. When reusing a shared footer CTA, keep the visible label and the internal action mode in the same tab-specific branch
- Symptom: The simple-profile footer still showed the install label, but a later generic submit-bar refresh reset `saveDataBtn.dataset.mode` back to `save`, so tapping the install CTA actually ran the save flow and surfaced unrelated errors.
- Lesson: If a shared footer button changes meaning by tab, handle that tab explicitly inside the common updater instead of only during the initial tab open. The text, classes, and `dataset.mode` must always be set together so a secondary refresh cannot leave the UI saying `install` while the click handler behaves like `save`.

## 2026-04-09 (simple-mode heading directness)

### 109. In simple mode, lead with the user task for that tab and remove redundant mode labels
- Symptom: The simple profile still opened with a `媛꾪렪 ?꾨줈?? chip, and the record tabs did not start with the clearest possible instruction even though the mode was already visually obvious.
- Lesson: For senior-facing simple mode, the first line of each screen should name the immediate action, like `?ㅻ뒛 ?앸떒 湲곕줉?섏꽭??, `?ㅻ뒛 ?대룞 湲곕줉?섏꽭??, or `?ㅻ뒛 留덉쓬 湲곕줉?섏꽭??. Do not spend the strongest visual slot repeating the mode name when the real job can be stated directly.

## 2026-04-09 (simple-mode critical actions)

### 110. Do not strip out core feature actions like AI analysis just because the layout is simplified
- Symptom: Simple mode hid the existing diet and sleep AI analysis buttons through a blanket CSS rule, so a core value feature disappeared even though the underlying analysis flow still existed.
- Lesson: When simplifying a senior-facing flow, remove clutter first but keep high-value primary actions visible. If an action is central to the product promise, preserve it in simple mode and restyle it to be clearer rather than hiding it with broad layout rules.

## 2026-04-09 (profile hydration after mode switches)

### 111. Do not trust the first user-doc read alone when profile UI depends on points or referral state
- Symptom: After switching between `/simple` and the default mode, profile surfaces could show `0P` and empty invite QR blocks until the user manually refreshed because the first auth-time user document read sometimes arrived without the latest profile fields.
- Lesson: For auth bootstrap and mode-switch entry, if the visible UI depends on fields like `coins` or `referralCode`, re-check the user document against fresh server state before treating the account as new or finalizing the profile UI. After that fetch, explicitly rehydrate the currently visible profile surfaces instead of assuming a later refresh will fix them.

## 2026-04-09 (localhost emulator restarts and data loss)

### 112. Before restarting localhost Firebase emulators, warn that local Firestore state may reset unless an import/export flow is configured
- Symptom: Restarting the local Firebase stack to recover `127.0.0.1:5000` also restarted Firestore, and localhost then showed `0P` because this project's emulator startup does not import persisted user data by default.
- Lesson: When the user is validating localhost behavior, do not restart the full emulator set casually. First check whether only Hosting is down. If Firestore is already serving the expected local state, keep it alive and recover only the missing piece. If a full restart is necessary, tell the user up front that localhost uses emulator data and may lose the current local points/profile state unless a seed or export is restored.

## 2026-04-10 (challenge rules copy)

### 113. User-facing challenge rules should describe the user outcome first, not the internal policy shorthand
- Symptom: A compact wallet challenge note using phrases like `65P+ ?몄젙`, `phase 蹂대꼫??, and `50% 諛섑솚/50% ?뚭컖` was technically accurate but too dense for a user to understand at a glance.
- Lesson: For challenge rewards and staking copy, avoid operator shorthand in the primary UI. Lead with the simple flow users care about, such as `?섎（ 65???댁긽?대㈃ 1???몄젙`, `80% ?댁긽?대㈃ ?덉튂湲덇낵 ?ъ씤?몃? ?뚮젮諛쏆븘??, and `?꾨? ?ъ꽦?섎㈃ HBT 蹂대꼫?ㅺ? ??遺숈뼱??.
## 2026-04-10 (challenge card copy deduplication)

### 114. When neighboring challenge cards share the same rule, keep the shared part minimal and let only the reward difference stand out
- Symptom: The weekly and master card subtitles repeated the same long qualifier about new starts and daily minimum points, so the two cards looked wordy even though the practical difference the user needed was just `100P` versus `500P`.
- Lesson: For side-by-side challenge summaries, compress the common rule into the shortest understandable phrase, such as `?섎（ 65???댁긽 쨌 80%+ ?섍툒`, and use the remaining space to emphasize the distinct reward value instead of repeating the same condition twice.

## 2026-04-10 (tokenomics page encoding safety)

### 115. After bulk documentation edits, verify the actual served HTML page instead of trusting only the markdown source or git diff
- Symptom: `HBT_TOKENOMICS.md` stayed readable, but `tokenomics.html` was committed with broken Korean text and the staging page visibly rendered garbled copy.
- Lesson: When a public document exists in both markdown and HTML, validate the HTML bytes and the served page before closing the task. If one source is corrupted, restore from the last known-good revision and then reapply only the intended textual changes in small, reviewable edits.

## 2026-04-10 (wallet and tokenomics copy alignment)

### 116. When a policy number changes, update the wallet fallback text and tokenomics docs together so the user never sees mixed limits
- Symptom: Runtime code already used a `12,000 HBT` daily cap, but the wallet's initial HTML and tokenomics docs still showed `5,000 HBT`, which made the product look inconsistent.
- Lesson: Any change to a user-facing policy number like an HBT cap must be reflected in the runtime constant, wallet fallback HTML, and tokenomics pages/docs in the same pass. If the product wants the current rule shown plainly, do not keep legacy qualifiers like `?좉퇋` in the primary UI copy.
## 2026-04-10 (tokenomics update stamp)

### 117. When public tokenomics content changes, update the visible "理쒖쥌 ?낅뜲?댄듃" stamp in both the HTML page and the source docs in the same pass
- Symptom: The tokenomics content had been revised, but the visible update stamp still showed `2026??3??31??, making the page look stale even after recent policy changes.
- Lesson: Treat the tokenomics update date as part of the shipped content. When copy or policy changes on the page, update the visible stamp in `tokenomics.html` and the mirrored source documents together before closing the task.
## 2026-04-10 (external dashboard certainty)

### 118. Do not state third-party dashboard security options as facts unless they are confirmed in current docs or UI
- Symptom: I advised setting a MetaMask Developer domain allowlist as if it were definitely available, but the current official docs and visible dashboard state did not clearly confirm a separate origin allowlist control.
- Lesson: For third-party developer consoles, verify the exact current UI or official docs before giving step-by-step security instructions. If a control is not confirmed, say so explicitly and only recommend settings that are actually visible or documented.

## 2026-04-10 (mobile wallet return flows)

### 119. When a mobile wallet handoff leaves the browser and returns later, do not rely on a single immediate recovery check
- Symptom: After approving MetaMask from the app, the browser returned to HaBit but the wallet UI stayed unchanged because recovery checked `eth_accounts` only once, before the SDK finished restoring the session.
- Lesson: For mobile wallet deeplink or WalletConnect returns, combine a short retry window with provider event listeners like `connect`, `accountsChanged`, and `chainChanged`. Restored sessions can arrive slightly after focus returns, so the UI must react to late events instead of assuming recovery is synchronous.

### 120. Do not delay wallet bootstrap so long that a post-approval browser return looks like a no-op
- Symptom: Mobile wallet approval could reload the browser tab, but wallet initialization still waited 10 seconds after login, so the user came back to an apparently unchanged wallet card.
- Lesson: If an external wallet handoff is pending, initialize wallet recovery almost immediately after auth resumes. Heavy blockchain tasks can stay delayed, but the visible wallet state must rehydrate quickly enough that the user sees the connection take effect.

### 121. Do not ship mobile wallet popup bridges that surface raw `about:blank` tabs to users
- Symptom: A workaround that pre-opened a blank browser tab kept the wallet launch tied to the original click, but on real devices it visibly showed an `about:blank` page and looked more broken than the original issue.
- Lesson: For mobile wallet handoffs, prefer same-tab deeplinks or clearly branded helper pages. Never expose a raw blank bridge tab in production UX, even if it improves popup reliability in theory.

### 122. Treat wallet in-app browsers as a fallback, not a default, until session continuity is proven
- Symptom: External-browser return flows were flaky enough that an in-app browser pivot looked attractive, but in a login-gated app that pivot introduced a larger product bug by dropping the authenticated session.
- Lesson: When mobile wallet return flows fail, do not jump straight to the wallet's in-app browser. First ask whether the app can preserve login continuity there. Only use the in-app browser as a primary path if authentication and state handoff are intentionally supported.

### 123. Do not pivot a login-gated app into wallet in-app browsers unless an auth handoff is explicitly designed
- Symptom: Sending HaBit into the MetaMask or Trust Wallet in-app browser broke the product model itself, because the user would lose the existing Firebase-authenticated session and land in an unauthenticated copy of the app.
- Lesson: Before adopting an in-app browser wallet flow, check whether the product depends on an existing login session. If the answer is yes, keep the wallet connection in the original browser unless you have implemented a deliberate auth handoff mechanism.

### 124. When adding a new wallet connection path, verify the actual button handler invokes that path
- Symptom: MetaMask Connect and Trust WalletConnect logic had been implemented, but the exported button handlers still called the generic injected-wallet function, so the new code never ran on real devices.
- Lesson: After adding alternative connection code, verify the public entrypoints used by the UI buttons call it in the intended environments. Do not assume helper functions are live just because they exist in the file.

### 125. For Trust Wallet mobile browser handoff, prefer the proven `link.trustwallet.com/wc?uri=` pattern over custom schemes
- Symptom: A custom `trust://` deeplink produced `ERR_UNKNOWN_URL_SCHEME`, while a working production site used `https://link.trustwallet.com/wc?uri=...` and recovered correctly after wallet approval.
- Lesson: When a live production reference and wallet docs converge on a specific deeplink pattern, copy that pattern instead of inventing a custom scheme. Validate mobile wallet handoff against a known-good implementation before shipping.

### 126. When debugging a PWA on staging, ship runtime cache-busting with behavior fixes or users may keep seeing the old bug
- Symptom: The wallet connection code changed repeatedly, but the user still experienced the same behavior because `app.js` and `main.js` version strings stayed unchanged, dynamic `blockchain-manager.js` imports had no version query, and the service-worker cache name was not bumped.
- Lesson: For staging fixes that depend on updated browser code, bump the visible script version, version any dynamic imports involved in the flow, and rotate the service-worker cache name in the same patch. Otherwise a user can truthfully report ?쐍othing changed??even when the repository diff is correct.

### 127. Do not force a full-page reload after popup auth success unless the product truly depends on it
- Symptom: On staging mobile browsers, Google popup login completed account selection but the app stayed on the landing screen because the code forced `window.location.reload()` both after `signInWithPopup()` resolved and again inside `onAuthStateChanged()`.
- Lesson: For popup-based Firebase login, let `onAuthStateChanged()` finish the signed-in UI transition naturally. A forced reload can race persistence in mobile browsers and erase the visible login success. If duplicate clicks are the concern, disable the login button while the popup is in flight instead of reloading the page.

### 128. Do not override a wallet SDK's browser deeplink handler with a React Native-style hook unless web behavior is proven
- Symptom: MetaMask mobile connection still felt inert because the app replaced the SDK's own browser deeplink/universal-link opening logic with a custom `preferredOpenLink` callback that was intended more for React Native environments than for Samsung Internet or Chrome.
- Lesson: On the web, prefer the wallet SDK's built-in browser deeplink flow first. Only override the open-link handler if the official web path is known to be broken and the replacement is verified on a real device.

### 129. For mobile WalletConnect retries, prefer a fresh provider per tap over reusing a warmed singleton
- Symptom: Trust Wallet taps could still feel like no-ops because a reused provider instance could carry a stale half-open WalletConnect state from an earlier failed attempt.
- Lesson: When a mobile WalletConnect flow is click-driven and user-facing, create a fresh provider for a fresh tap unless you are explicitly recovering an existing pending session. Reusing a warmed singleton is fine for reconnect recovery, but it is risky as the default for first-time connection attempts.

### 130. Do not spend the first mobile wallet tap loading SDK bundles or forcing custom URI schemes unless the official web defaults are proven wrong
- Symptom: MetaMask and Trust Wallet buttons still felt inert on Samsung Internet because the click path was paying for module/client setup before reaching the actual connect call, MetaMask was still forced onto the `metamask://` scheme, and Trust Wallet had drifted from the provider's documented `optionalChains` init path.
- Lesson: For mobile wallet launch flows, preload SDK bundles before the user taps, stay close to the wallet SDK's documented web defaults, and only force custom schemes or non-default init options after they are proven necessary on a real device.

### 131. After repeated real-device reports of ?쐍o improvement,??stop claiming progress and explicitly pivot or pause
- Symptom: Several staging redeploys changed wallet connection internals, but the user still experienced the same no-op behavior on the phone. My responses focused too much on what changed in code, not on the fact that the user-facing result had not improved.
- Lesson: For device-specific UX bugs, the only meaningful progress is observable behavior on the user?셲 device. If two or more rounds still produce ?쐍othing changed,??stop iterating on the same implementation path, say clearly that the current approach has not been solved, and propose a new architecture or a pause instead of implying the latest patch should fix it.

### 132. When a high-friction advanced feature is failing, do not keep presenting it as the default path in the main product UI
- Symptom: External wallet connection was unreliable on the target mobile browsers, but the wallet card still framed MetaMask and Trust Wallet as the primary next step, which made the product feel broken even though the app wallet flow itself worked.
- Lesson: If an advanced flow is not reliable enough for the core audience, move it out of the primary path. Update the main UI copy so the working default is unmistakable, and keep advanced actions secondary until the experience is proven on real devices.

### 133. For popup auth on mobile browsers, do not make the first visible signed-in transition depend entirely on `onAuthStateChanged()`
- Symptom: Google popup login technically succeeded, but Samsung Internet could still sit on the landing screen after account selection because the opener tab waited for the auth-state event before hiding the login modal and revealing the signed-in shell.
- Lesson: When popup auth resolves successfully, bridge the opener tab into a lightweight signed-in shell state immediately, then let `onAuthStateChanged()` finish the full hydration. This preserves correctness while removing the ?쏧 chose an account and nothing happened??feeling on slower mobile browsers.

### 134. When an experimental integration is removed from the product path, delete its heavy browser assets too
- Symptom: External wallet connection had already been de-prioritized in the UI, but the large MetaMask/WalletConnect browser bundles were still shipped and cached, which pushed Android site data to roughly 4.6MB even though users could no longer benefit from those assets.
- Lesson: After a feature pivot, remove the dead runtime imports, vendor bundles, package scripts, and cache references in the same pass. Otherwise the product keeps paying the storage and cache cost of an abandoned experiment.

### 135. Background uploads must not hijack the save CTA before the user actually presses save
- Symptom: Selecting an exercise video immediately changed the main save button to a `saving... XX%` state, which made it feel like the record was already being saved before the user pressed `?대룞 ??ν븯怨??ъ씤??諛쏄린`.
- Lesson: Background media uploads can start early for performance, but their progress should stay internal until the user presses the save CTA. Only after save begins should upload progress be reflected in the visible button text or save-state UI.

### 136. User-facing update notes should use plain language first, not internal engineering terms
- Symptom: The changelog wording used terms like `fail-fast`, `mainnet readiness`, and other internal phrases that make sense to engineers but feel hard to scan for regular users.
- Lesson: For release notes, prefer short user outcomes over implementation terms. Write what changed in everyday language, and keep technical details for internal docs rather than the public update page.

### 137. When changing an admin ranking metric, update every related admin view and summary card to the same source of truth
- Symptom: The economy tab TOP 20 was changed to a combined `points + HBT` ranking, but the dashboard TOP 5 and headline stats still used older per-field shortcuts, so operators saw inconsistent ordering and misleading totals.
- Lesson: For admin/ops surfaces, treat ranking logic and KPI cards as one package. If the ranking formula or source data changes, update the dashboard summary, detail table, and supporting stat cards together so the control tower never shows mixed definitions.

### 138. After patching `admin.html`, verify the extracted module script directly before assuming the control tower login still works
- Symptom: The control tower Google popup could complete, but the page stayed on the login screen because `admin.html` had stray braces and a broken inline module block around the admin auth helpers.
- Lesson: `admin.html` does not go through the main app bundle, so `app.js` and `main.js` build checks are not enough. After any manual edit to the control tower page, extract the module script from the raw file bytes and run `node --check` on it before deploying. Avoid `Get-Content`-based extraction when the file contains Korean text, because PowerShell encoding can create false negatives during syntax verification.

### 139. On BSC mainnet, wallet transfer history must not depend on the default dataseed RPC for `eth_getLogs`
- Symptom: The HBT wallet history UI shipped a merge path for real onchain inflow/outflow, but prod still showed only challenge staking rows because `getHbtTransferHistory` kept failing with `method eth_getLogs in batch triggered rate limit` / `limit exceeded`.
- Lesson: For BSC mainnet history features, prove the chosen RPC can serve `eth_getLogs` before shipping. Do not assume the default `bsc-dataseed.binance.org` endpoint is suitable for transfer-history scans. Use a history-safe fallback provider order, keep `eth_getLogs` sequential/non-batched, and verify with a real wallet address that recent transfers are returned before deploying.

### 140. Wallet asset cards must preserve the last known balances and retry in the background instead of blanking on transient reads
- Symptom: The points/HBT cards would occasionally show missing data until the user refreshed several times.
- Root cause: `updateAssetDisplay()` treated a timed-out Firestore read like an empty user doc, replaced visible HBT with a loading placeholder, and gave up after a single failed onchain read.
- Lesson: For balance surfaces, never clear good values just because one live read is slow or transiently fails. Cache the last known points/HBT values, render them immediately, and retry failed Firestore/onchain balance reads in the background before asking the user to refresh.

### 141. Mainnet HBT history RPC fallbacks must treat provider block-range limits like retryable scan shrink signals
- Symptom: The live wallet stayed stuck on only challenge staking rows even after the onchain history merge shipped.
- Root cause: `getHbtTransferHistory` only recognized classic rate-limit messages, but providers such as `1rpc.io/bnb` fail large `eth_getLogs` scans with messages like `limited to 0 - 10000 blocks range`. That bypassed the chunk-shrink path and left the wallet with empty onchain transfer results.
- Lesson: In HBT transfer history scans, classify provider block-range-limit errors as retryable alongside rate limits. Read `error.error.message` as well as top-level messages, then shrink the scan chunk instead of falling through to an empty history.

### 142. Post-save gallery refreshes must preserve cached feed items until Firestore catches up
- Symptom: Right after uploading a photo or video, moving to the gallery tab could show an empty feed even though the save had succeeded.
- Root cause: the save flow cleared `cachedGalleryLogs` immediately and relied on an asynchronous gallery reload to repopulate it. Users who switched tabs before that fetch completed landed on a blank cache.
- Lesson: For save -> gallery flows, never wipe the feed cache before the replacement data arrives. Optimistically upsert the saved record into the gallery cache, render from the last known cache first, and treat background refresh failures as non-destructive when cached content already exists.

### 143. Browser handoff flows must not treat one transient chatbot API failure like a lost connect token
- Symptom: Entering the app from the KakaoTalk Haebit Coach `!연결` button could land on a connect warning even though the URL token handoff itself was intact.
- Root cause: the app already preserved the full URL during the in-app-browser -> external-browser transition, but the client made a one-shot request to the chatbot server. If the Render service was still waking up or the handoff network was briefly unstable, the UI looked like a lost-connection problem.
- Lesson: For cross-browser handoff flows, distinguish “token lost” from “token lookup temporarily failed.” Keep the handoff token in the URL, add timeout/retry behavior around token lookup/completion calls, and only surface terminal errors when the server has actually rejected the token.

### 144. When a fix lives only in `functions`, a hosting-only deploy does not change the live behavior
- Symptom: the HBT 거래 기록 UI stayed unchanged even after later prod deploys, because it still showed only challenge staking rows.
- Root cause: the actual fix (`c35c990`) was server-only in `functions/index.js`, but subsequent deploys were `hosting` only. We mentally bundled the feature with the UI and overlooked that the live callable never changed.
- Lesson: For mixed client/server features, explicitly record whether the fix is `hosting`, `functions`, or both. Before telling the user a live bug should be fixed, confirm that the changed surface was actually deployed to the right Firebase target.

### 145. Daily media saves must preserve existing items and decouple document save from long-running uploads
- Symptom: uploading a new photo or short video could take too long, and in some cases previously saved media for the same day disappeared after saving.
- Root cause: the save flow awaited pending uploads end-to-end before writing the daily log, and exercise media lists were rewritten from the current DOM snapshot without a stable item identity or a preserve-unless-deleted merge.
- Lesson: For media-heavy diary flows, treat upload and document save as separate stages. Save the log immediately with the latest known persisted media, continue unresolved uploads in the background, and merge media arrays by stable item ids so existing content stays until the user explicitly removes it.

### 146. Long-running media uploads must expose per-file progress instead of generic warnings or invisible background state
- Symptom: asking users not to refresh or just telling them an upload is running still left too much uncertainty, especially for short videos that can take noticeably longer than photos.
- Root cause: the app already tracked per-input upload progress internally, but that state only fed the save CTA and a generic background chip. The actual photo/video slot gave no immediate feedback about how far each file had progressed.
- Lesson: When client-side uploads can take more than a moment, surface progress on the exact media slot the user just selected. Show percent + complete/error state per file, and start the upload only after validation passes so users never pay for an upload they cancelled.

### 147. Save reconciliation must not clear unresolved background uploads before their Firestore patch finishes
- Symptom: a sleep photo could show `일부 업로드 실패`, then a second save would look successful, but the media still disappeared after refresh.
- Root cause: the immediate post-save reconciliation path called `persistSavedPreview` / `persistSavedExerciseBlock` even when the Storage upload was still pending. Those helpers cleared `_pendingUploads` and the file input before `runBackgroundMediaSyncJobs()` could resolve the upload result and patch Firestore.
- Lesson: When save and upload are decoupled, reconciliation helpers must preserve unresolved pending uploads. Only clear the pending entry and file input after a real Storage URL exists or the upload has conclusively failed.

### 148. Background media pipelines need an explicit in-slot intermediate state once the original file exists but the final thumbnail does not
- Symptom: even after the overall upload flow was improved, the user still had to ask why a photo/video slot could look unfinished after upload because the UI did not clearly distinguish `original uploaded, thumbnail still preparing`.
- Root cause: I focused on the floating/global upload status and backend timing, but the media slot itself did not explain the remaining step. For videos especially, a placeholder frame alone does not communicate whether the upload is still running or just the thumbnail is pending.
- Lesson: Whenever media saving has a post-upload thumbnail/finalization phase, show that phase directly inside the affected slot with a clear label like `썸네일 제작중`. Do not rely only on a global progress card or generic placeholder imagery to explain that intermediate state.

### 149. Do not rely on canvas extraction from persisted Firebase Storage videos for core preview UI
- Symptom: a saved strength video could suddenly fall back to the generic placeholder, and the console showed CORS errors against `firebasestorage.googleapis.com`.
- Root cause: I treated "saved video with no thumb URL yet" as something the client could always recover by drawing the remote video into a canvas. Firebase download URLs do not reliably allow that CORS path, so the fallback was not dependable.
- Lesson: For persisted video preview UI, never make cross-origin canvas extraction the primary recovery path. Prefer a stored thumb URL, a local extracted frame, or an actual `<video>` element fallback that can show the frame without requiring canvas access.

### 150. Multi-mode media previews must be overlaid in one frame, not appended as separate blocks
- Symptom: after adding a `<video>` fallback for saved exercise cards, the preview could render as two stacked surfaces instead of one media frame.
- Root cause: I added both `<img>` and `<video>` elements into the preview shell but left them in normal document flow. When visibility toggles were not enough to guarantee exclusive layout, the elements could stack vertically.
- Lesson: For previews that can switch between image and video renderers, define the shell as a fixed-ratio positioned frame and absolutely overlay each renderer inside it. Never rely on sequential block layout for mutually exclusive preview surfaces.

### 151. If a just-extracted media thumbnail matters after save, persist a client cache keyed by the final media URL
- Symptom: after removing the cross-origin canvas fallback, a saved exercise video could still lose its visible thumbnail and fall back to a black or generic preview even though the client had already extracted a usable local frame earlier in the session.
- Root cause: I treated `data-local-thumb` as purely DOM-local state. Once the card was rebuilt from saved data, that state was gone unless a remote `videoThumbUrl` had already arrived.
- Lesson: When an upload flow extracts a valuable local thumbnail before the remote thumb is finalized, cache it client-side against the eventual persisted media URL and consult that cache during later rehydration. Do not throw away user-visible preview assets just because the DOM was recreated.

### 152. “Original URL exists” is not the same as “media upload is fully settled”
- Symptom: a saved exercise video kept reopening without a thumbnail even after multiple UI fallback tweaks, because `videoThumbUrl` was never written back to Firestore.
- Root cause: the save flow treated `_pendingUploads.result.url` as if the whole media pipeline was complete. When the original upload had finished but `thumbPromise` was still running, we skipped background patch scheduling and cleared the pending entry too early.
- Lesson: In split upload pipelines, model “original done / thumbnail pending” as its own live state. Keep the pending entry, schedule the background patch, and only mark the media fully settled after the thumbnail promise has either produced a persisted thumb URL or definitively failed.

### 153. When old data is already missing a thumbnail, the UI should degrade gracefully instead of advertising work it is not doing
- Symptom: on refresh, an old exercise video with no persisted `videoThumbUrl` showed `썸네일 제작중`, then a live frame appeared seconds later, while the gallery share card rendered an ugly placeholder tile.
- Root cause: I mixed “actively generating a new thumb” with “showing a live video fallback because a thumb is absent.” Those are not the same user state, especially for records already saved in broken form.
- Lesson: If the app is merely falling back to a live video frame for an old thumb-less record, hide processing copy once the frame is visible and omit that media from thumbnail-first surfaces like share cards until a real preview asset exists.

### 154. Share-card media caches must be invalidated when late thumbnails arrive
- Symptom: the exercise tab or gallery feed could recover a strength-video thumbnail, but the gallery's “해빛 루틴” share card kept showing an older placeholder tile.
- Root cause: the share card prepared its own media payload and cached that result separately from the normal gallery media render path. Later local-thumb binding or background thumb patching updated the preview surfaces, but never invalidated the share-card cache.
- Lesson: When a late thumbnail changes the visual media set, invalidate every downstream cache that depends on it, not just the obvious on-screen preview. For Habitschool, that includes the prepared share-card media cache as well as the gallery feed item.

### 155. Share-card collectors must not drop videos before async thumbnail recovery gets a chance
- Symptom: the gallery feed could still show or recover a strength-video preview, but the “해빛 루틴” share card omitted or placeholdered the same video because it never attempted the later local-thumb recovery path.
- Root cause: `collectShareCardMedia()` only added strength videos when a synchronous thumb source (`localThumb` or `videoThumbUrl`) already existed. If the thumb lived only in slower persistent client cache, the share-card preparation stage never saw the video item at all.
- Lesson: For media that can recover thumbnails asynchronously, collect the media item from its stable original URL first, then resolve the preview asset in the async preparation phase. Do not require a synchronous preview source at collection time.

### 156. Browser-local thumbnail caches do not solve cross-device share-card previews
- Symptom: a strength-video tile could still show a placeholder in the desktop gallery share card even after we cached local thumbnails successfully on the uploading device.
- Root cause: the local thumbnail cache lived only in that specific browser profile. When the user uploaded on mobile and later inspected the share card on desktop, there was no local cached frame to reuse, and missing `videoThumbUrl` left the server callable with nothing image-like to return.
- Lesson: For share surfaces that must work across devices, client-only thumbnail caches are just an optimization. Always provide a server-visible fallback, either by persisting `videoThumbUrl` reliably or by generating a thumbnail from the stored video object when the share asset is requested.

### 157. List-first exercise restore paths must inherit matching legacy thumbnail fields during schema transition
- Symptom: the exercise tab and the gallery share-card preview could render a black video frame or placeholder even though the daily log still contained a valid legacy `strengthVideoThumbUrl`.
- Root cause: newer UI paths preferred `exercise.strengthList` and ignored the older `exercise.strengthVideoThumbUrl`. When save flows wrote a list item without `videoThumbUrl` but preserved the legacy fields, the renderers threw away an already saved thumbnail.
- Lesson: When a media schema evolves from single-item fields to list items, any list-first restore path must reconcile missing per-item thumbnails against matching legacy fields before falling back to live video rendering or placeholder assets.

### 158. Samsung Internet should use redirect auth when Google popup login behaves like a stranded extra tab
- Symptom: on first login in Samsung Internet, choosing a Google account could leave the user on the Google/Firebase auth surface or require a back action / second tap before the app felt signed in.
- Root cause: `signInWithPopup()` behaves more like a separate tab on Samsung Internet, so even with opener-side shell bridging the login can feel incomplete or require manual return. The app also lacked a persistent pending-login recovery path for when auth completed while the browser was switching focus.
- Lesson: For Samsung Internet, prefer `signInWithRedirect()` over popup auth. Pair it with redirect-result recovery and a short-lived pending-login marker so the app can resume the signed-in shell immediately when the browser returns.

### 159. Simple-mode guidance copy should keep only the action, not scaffolding around it
- Symptom: the first simple-profile guidance version still carried extra framing text like `여기서 시작하세요` and category labels, which made the top of the screen feel busier than the user wanted.
- Root cause: I optimized for explicit explanation instead of preserving the minimum action cue that the user actually asked for.
- Lesson: In simple-mode guidance, default to the shortest actionable phrase and use visual affordances like arrows for context. If the action already points at the target tabs, remove redundant heading and category labels.

### 160. Persistent install CTAs should be gated by browser context, not by mobile-only assumptions
- Symptom: after restoring the missing `installState.visible` gate, the `해빛스쿨 앱 설치` footer disappeared entirely on a normal desktop browser that was not installed.
- Root cause: `shouldShowInstallCta()` still hard-blocked all non-mobile user agents and also depended on stored installed-state hints, which contradicted the user’s expectation of a persistent install CTA surface.
- Lesson: For Habitschool’s bottom-bar install CTA, treat “browser vs installed standalone app” as the primary distinction. If the app is running in a normal browser and not localhost, keep the install CTA visible and let the action branch into native prompt or manual guidance as needed.

### 161. When a simple-mode guide is reduced to one line, emphasize it with size and centering
- Symptom: after shortening the simple-profile guidance to a single phrase, the message still felt too quiet because it kept the same small left-aligned treatment as a longer paragraph.
- Root cause: I simplified the copy but left the visual hierarchy tuned for multi-line explanatory text.
- Lesson: If a simple-mode guide is only one short action line, increase the type size and center it so the message feels intentional rather than leftover body copy.

### 162. Optional onchain enrichment on a core asset screen should be removable when it becomes the unstable part
- Symptom: the asset tab mixed a stable Firestore-backed HBT history with a slow/failing onchain callable, which produced 504/CORS-looking console noise and made the screen feel like basic information was missing.
- Root cause: I kept treating the onchain transfer lookup as mandatory enrichment even after the user decided the extra scan was not worth the instability. That left a secondary feature in the critical rendering path.
- Lesson: When a screen already has a stable primary data source, keep optional onchain enrichment behind a clean boundary. If that enrichment becomes the unstable piece and the user prefers stability, remove it cleanly instead of continuing to tune around it.

### 163. Deferred-upload tabs must not consume the transfer before the floating tracker starts
- Symptom: the strength-video bottom upload bar appeared only near the end, even though the actual upload had been running for a while.
- Root cause: I still awaited the original video upload URL in the save path before I queued the “background” job, so by the time the floating tracker started there was almost no transfer left to show.
- Lesson: If a tab is meant to behave like the app’s deferred-upload flows, do not block the save path on the original media URL first. Queue the background job while the transfer is still in flight so the tracker reflects real upload progress from the start.

### 164. Video upload completion should include deferred thumbnail patching
- Symptom: the UI could say the background upload was complete while a strength-video thumbnail was still missing or still being patched.
- Root cause: I ended the floating tracker after the primary media patch and treated late thumbnail persistence as an invisible afterthought.
- Lesson: For video media, keep the completion state and progress tracker open until deferred thumbnail patching settles. Otherwise the app declares success before the preview surface is actually done.

### 165. Exercise-tab media restore must reuse the same thumbnail recovery path as post-save patches
- Symptom: the gallery could show a usable strength-video thumbnail, but the exercise tab still rendered a blank/placeholder preview for the same saved record.
- Root cause: I let the exercise-tab initial restore keep a separate lighter-weight preview branch, while the stronger thumbnail recovery logic lived in `persistSavedExerciseBlock(...)`. The two surfaces drifted apart.
- Lesson: When a media surface already has a battle-tested post-save restore function, reuse it for initial data hydration too. Do not maintain a second, simpler restore path for the same media type.

### 166. Live video fallbacks should not hide the placeholder before the first frame is ready
- Symptom: a saved strength-video without a persisted thumbnail could appear blank in the exercise tab even though the fallback video source was valid.
- Root cause: `showStrengthPreviewVideo(...)` hid the placeholder image immediately and only then waited for video events, so any delay or browser-specific frame behavior produced an empty preview.
- Lesson: For video-preview fallbacks, keep the placeholder or prior image visible until the first renderable video frame is confirmed. Only swap surfaces after `loadeddata`/equivalent readiness proves the frame exists.

### 171. Android installed-app cold starts must keep a branded loading state until the browser shell is actually visible
- Symptom: after fixing the hard launch failure, tapping the installed APK could still feel broken because Chrome/TWA cold start spent several seconds on a blank white surface before the web app appeared.
- Root cause: I treated “browser launch requested” as equivalent to “the user now sees meaningful app UI.” In reality, Chrome first-run prompts and slow custom-tab startup can leave a long white gap after the native handoff.
- Lesson: For Habitschool’s Android shell, never hand users directly from the launcher into an unstyled browser cold-start gap. Keep a visible branded loading screen until the trusted surface is ready enough to take over, and pre-warm the custom-tab provider before launching.

### 172. Browser fallbacks must exclude the app's own verified-link package or they can loop back into the launcher
- Symptom: even after adding a visible loading shell, the installed Android app could still appear frozen on white because the timeout fallback reopened `com.habitschool.app/.HabitschoolLauncherActivity` instead of a real browser.
- Root cause: I fired a plain `ACTION_VIEW` intent for `https://habitschool.web.app/...` while the app itself had a verified-link intent filter for the same host. Android resolved the fallback back into the app, creating a self-loop.
- Lesson: If an Android shell claims the same web origin via app links, any “open in browser” fallback must explicitly resolve an external browser package and exclude the app package. Never assume a bare `ACTION_VIEW` on your own domain will escape the app.

### 173. Hosted APK links must never depend on ephemeral build-output paths
- Symptom: the shared `/install/android.apk` URL could suddenly return `page not found` after a web-only staging deploy, even though the link itself had not changed.
- Root cause: Firebase Hosting redirected the install URL straight to `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`, but temp worktree deploys did not always contain that untracked build artifact.
- Lesson: Serve APK downloads from a stable hosted path such as `install/android.apk`, and make deploy-time automation prepare that file before Hosting uploads. Do not expose raw local build-output paths as public install URLs.

### 174. Do not “fix” TWA launcher issues by routing the primary app entry into a normal browser tab
- Symptom: the installed Android app finally opened, but the top chrome became thick and the address bar was visible, which broke the expected app-like shell.
- Root cause: I treated the white-screen launcher problem as a reason to send `ACTION_MAIN + CATEGORY_LAUNCHER` straight into a normal browser surface. That changed the product surface from TWA to regular Chrome. On top of that, the timeout budget started before warmup and could still auto-open browser fallback too early.
- Lesson: For Habitschool’s launcher, keep the primary entry on the TWA path. If cold-start timing is slow, adjust the timeout budget and make launcher fallback manual inside the native loading UI instead of automatically replacing the shell with a normal browser tab.

### 175. Android TWA verification must include post-launch ANR/timeout observation, not just the first resumed activity
- Symptom: I reported the launcher fix as good after seeing `CustomTabActivity` become top resumed, but the user still hit `Chrome isn't responding` shortly afterward.
- Root cause: my verification window ended too early. A TWA flow can look correct for the first few seconds and still fail later when timeout policy or Chrome process state kicks in.
- Lesson: For Habitschool’s Android shell, do not stop at “TWA opened.” Force-stop app + Chrome, cold-start the launcher, then watch at least 25-30 seconds and inspect logcat for `TWA launch timed out`, `Opened browser surface`, `ANR`, or `Input dispatching timed out` before declaring the launcher stable.

### 176. Primary Android launcher startup must not block on Health Connect IPC
- Symptom: the installed Android app could stay on the branded loading screen and even hit an ANR before any web surface appeared.
- Root cause: `HabitschoolLauncherActivity` synchronously called `HealthConnectManager.hasRequiredPermissions()` via `runBlocking` on the main thread during cold start, putting Health Connect binder latency directly on the launcher critical path.
- Lesson: On cold start, the primary launcher may reuse only cheap cached Health Connect snapshot data. Do not synchronously query Health Connect permissions or records before handing off to the web surface.

### 177. If TWA handoff stalls, the launcher must auto-open an in-app fallback instead of waiting on the loading screen
- Symptom: even after removing some browser-loop issues, the Android launcher could still leave the user parked on the branded loading UI when trusted-surface handoff did not complete promptly.
- Root cause: the launcher depended on manual escape hatches or external browser fallback instead of opening a guaranteed in-app surface.
- Lesson: For Habitschool’s primary Android launcher, if trusted-surface launch stalls or throws, automatically open an in-app WebView fallback. Do not leave the user trapped on the native loading screen waiting for manual recovery.

### 178. Gallery first paint must never wait on secondary social data
- Symptom: after first login or immediately after an upload, the gallery tab could show hero UI plus endless skeleton cards until the user refreshed, and sometimes the next retry still waited behind the same stuck state.
- Root cause: `_loadGalleryDataInner()` started friendship loading in parallel but still awaited it before the first feed render. At the same time, the gallery loader had no stale in-flight reset, so a wedged `_galleryLoadingPromise` could block later reload attempts too.
- Lesson: For gallery/feed surfaces, treat friendship and similar social enrichments as optional follow-up data. Render the feed from cached/fetched logs first, rerender when enrichment arrives, and give the load gate its own stale-timeout recovery so one hung request cannot poison the next reload.
# 2026-04-11 (Mainnet Migration Economics)

### 60. Mainnet migration must preserve the live source-chain economics instead of resetting to constructor defaults
- Symptom: it is easy to assume a fresh mainnet deployment can start from the constructor default rate (`1P = 1 HBT`) and then migrate balances afterward.
- Root cause: deploy-time defaults and migration-time economics are different concerns. Users already earned balances under the live source-chain rate and policy, so resetting the destination chain changes effective value.
- Lesson: when planning a chain cutover, snapshot the live source-chain rate/policy first and preserve that economics during migration. Do not design migration math around fresh deploy defaults if users have already accrued balances under another live rate.

### 61. Mainnet cutover copy must follow the active chain config and onchain rate, not stale defaults
- Symptom: wallet and tokenomics surfaces can keep showing strings like `BSC ?뚯뒪?몃꽬`, `1:1`, or `100P = 100 HBT` even after the live addresses and `currentRate` changed.
- Root cause: default UI placeholders and docs were written for an earlier rollout stage and were not tied back to the active chain config or live onchain stats.
- Lesson: during chain cutover work, make wallet copy, explorer links, network badges, and tokenomics notes derive from the active chain config and current onchain rate where possible. Avoid hardcoding launch-era or testnet-era values into wallet defaults.
